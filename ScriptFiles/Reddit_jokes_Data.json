Nobody knows, because nobody ever reads what moderators write.  ------  Yes, it was a bad joke, but at least it wasn't a repost... which is *kind of* what we're here to discuss today:  As many of you are no doubt aware, spammers and bad actors have been flooding Reddit lately, and /r/Jokes has started to get hit pretty hard. Dealing with the issue isn't as easy as it sounds, though, because any action that we take has the potential to affect good-faith users. Still, we've been discussing the problem, and we've come up with the beginnings of a solution:   We're going to ban every last one of our subscribers.  Just kidding! In fact, we're going to give you a bit more insight into how spammers work, what their goals are, and why they're so effective on Reddit. This information will be included on [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index), which we've also streamlined and updated. (The rules themselves haven't changed; we've just made them a bit clearer and more condensed.) Our hope is that you'll be able to recognize and report spammers when you see them, which will help us keep them from gaining more of a foothold here.  We'll be taking some other anti-spam actions behind the scenes, so rest assured, we aren't trying to dump the spam-fighting on you. We just figured that it was better to keep everyone informed... because after all, /r/Jokes is a community, and a community is only as smart as its dumbest member.  (Yes, the moderators count as members, and yes, we're easily the dumbest.)

She starts to check the parrots and notices one with a price tag 1/10th of the next cheapest. She asks about why this parrot is so cheap to the store owner, and he replies \"That parrot has the mouth of a sailor that's why he is so cheap\".   Lady thinks about it believes it couldn't be that bad since it is just a parrot and guesses he does not know many words, and buys the parrot for $50.  She takes the parrot to her house and as soon as they enter the room, parrot says \"Nice brothel, whore!\". She ignores this and gets ready to go on her date.  Once she gets back home with her date, the parrot says \"Welcome to the brothel whore, who is this bastard?\". Embarrased by the parrot to her date, she takes the parrot back to the pet shop and tells the store owner \"Make this parrot talk kindly and I'll give you $350 more.\". The store owner John accepts the deal.   Once she leaves, John takes the parrot to the back room, asks the parrot what he will say once she gets back home and parrot says \"I will say' Welcome to the brothel, whore!'\". John says no, you will say \"Welcome home madame\". John asks again and parrot still says \"I'll say welcome to the brothel whore\" and John tries to correct the parrot again. This goes on for a couple repeats with no sign of improvement on the language.   Tired of the repetitive words of the parrot, John brings a bucket full of water and asks the parrot one more time, parrot replies the same. So, John puts the parrots head in water for a while and pulls him back up and asks again. Parrot replies the same and John puts the parrots head underwater again. After a few cycles parrot says \"Ok, ok, I will say welcome to your home madame\".  After confirming the parrots response, John calls the lady to pick up the parrot. Lady arrives to the store and asks John whether she can test the parrot. Trusting his work, John agrees.   Lady asks the parrot \"What will you say when I get home?\", and the parrot says \"Welcome to your home madame.\". Lady asks \"What will you say when I get home with a man?\", parrot says \"Welcome home madame and monsieur.\". Lady trying the parrot asks \"What will you say when I get home with two men?\", the parrot says \"Welcome home madame, welcome home misters.\"   Still not convinced, she asks the parrot \"What will you say when I get home with 3 men?\"   The parrot stays silent for a moment and then screams, \"John!
