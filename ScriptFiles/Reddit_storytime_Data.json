So to clarify my age I'm 15(f) and my bsf is 18(m) yup friends since childhood but now you can see my issue, the age difference is far apart and when I swear it was in the heat of the moment it was an accidental well not accidental let's drop the story ( my mom wasn't home she was dropping off my SIL so we're home alone my legs r on his legs w the chairs up it's silent and then out of nowhere he ask me \"hey umm do you remember when I almost kissed you?\" Of course I say no because I have short term memory (bsf: well I was wondering if I could kiss you I've just been really pent up lately but if ur not comfortable that's cool) my dumb ass not knowing what in hells name he just said I say \"yeah sure\" and we kissed...and so yeah we made out I don't know what to do because he said he liked it and I did too but the place I'm in I can't consent until I'm 16-18 so what do I do\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"]]
