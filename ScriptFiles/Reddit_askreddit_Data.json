[["AskReddit's 15th anniversary t-shirt design contest", "This is the official thread to submit your designs for this contest, so post your submission as a top-level comment here.   This contest will remain open for a month and will conclude on **February 21st, 2023 at 7pm CT**, so you have until then to submit a design. Following that the mods will choose from designs that we feel best fit the spirit of the sub, similar to how we did 5 years ago for [our 10th anniversary contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7gurqh/announcing_a_very_special_contest/), and the community will vote on those designs. For reference [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7nf0xk/announcement_please_vote_for_the_askreddit_10th) are the designs that were voted on back then and [here](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/askreddit-10th-anniversary-collection) is the fundraising campaign were we raised $3,621 for Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) International through sales and donations.  The winner of the best design will receive a free shirt and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place will receive a special community award that will give them 5 years, 3 years, and 1 year of Reddit Premium respectively.    **A few guidelines to consider:**  * Please no NSFW designs (sorry that means no cumboxes)  * Please keep designs limited to one side (either front or back)  * Please have the images be as high resolution as possible and CustomInk has requested the image be vectored if possible. These are the accepted file types: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, .pdf, .ai and .psd   * Please avoid using anything that is trademarked, except for Snoo. We will work with the admins to get permission for the final design.  We look forward to seeing what this community comes up with!  \\- The /r/AskReddit Moderators"]]
