[["I regret drifting apart from my sister", "She's only about a year and a half younger than me. I have an older brother, but my sister and I were inseparable when we were younger. We did everything together. I shared my friends with her and she shared hers with me. We took turns playing with my action figures and her dolls. We had all the same favorite shows. I remember once when were we really young we planned to run away together because our mom punished us. We actually packed a box with food and supplies. We didn't go through with it, but sometimes I kind of wish we did. It's a nice thought to me because then I can imagine that we would have stayed as close as we were then.  Around puberty we went our separate ways. We never had a falling out. Our adolescent brains just took us in different directions and that was that. She married her high school sweetheart and has a family now. We didn't have a very good childhood but she rose above the trauma and I'm really proud of her, but she feels almost like a stranger to me now. I'm still stuck in the trauma and I rarely even see her anymore. I think she must miss it, too, but going back isn't an option and at some point you just accept that. I think nature didn't give us much choice.  A few weeks ago there was a family gathering and my sister met my SO for the first time. There was a moment where I was standing there looking at my favorite person in the world when I was younger and my favorite person now, and they were talking and smiling at each other, and it just felt so surreal, but in some deep way it made me happy."]]
