[["TIFU by sending pictures of myself", "So i had met this girl online and we had started sexting and flirting, everything seemed fine. Little did i know. She then started asking for nudes which i declined because i just didn\u2019t want to. I finally submitted and sent them, i was then bombarded by aggressive texts and emails asking for me to send money to her otherwise she\u2019ll send it to all my family and friends, she even showed me my family\u2019s facebook pages. I cannot stop panicking and overthinking, i have a very good job and im scared i could literally lose it all over this. Does anyone have any advice on what i should do? I cannot stop panicking.\n\nI deleted my email account and any social media she had and i\u2019m hoping it all blows over and she doesn\u2019t go through with it, she was initially asking for \u00a31000. I have considered just paying her to avoid the troubles but \u00a31000 is \u00a31000 which i can\u2019t really afford. Do i go to the police for blackmail? I mean is it even bad if family and friends see pictures of me? ( i\u2019m just trying to justify it )\n\nTL;DR, i sent nudes and now if i don\u2019t pay them they\u2019ll expose me"]]
